Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website to showcase my significant software projects created during my time at Flatiron School and beyond. In addition to software I also included a timeline showing a selection of my other accomplishments over the years. I created this site using the React framework in order to gain more practice with React/JavaScript and hosting. This site is intended to act as a visual resume of my work and personal life.
